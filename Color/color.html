	<h2 style="color:white">Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Primary</h3>
    <p>Primary colors are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors. For human applications, three primary colors are typically used, since human color vision is usually trichromatic.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Secondary</h3>
    <p>The secondary colors are cyan (a mixture of blue and green), magenta (a mixture of blue and red), and yellow (a mixture of green and red). Each secondary color is also the complementary color (or complement) of the primary color whose wavelength it does not contain.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Tertiary</h3>
    <p>A tertiary color or quaternary color is a made by mixing either one color with one, or two secondary colors, in a given such as RGB[1] and CMYK (more modern) or RYB[2] (traditional).</p>

<section id="models">
	<h2 style="color:white">Color Models</h2>
	<p>Cathode ray tube, LCD, plasma and LED displays all utilize the RGB model. In order to create a color with RGB, three colored light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed. With no intensity,each of the three colors is perceived as black, while full intensity leads to a perception of seeing white.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Analogous</h3>
	<p>Analogous colors that sit next to each other on the color wheel. They tend to look pleasant together because they are closely related. </p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>A Monochromatic color having tones, tints and shades of one color in addition to the ground hue.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Triadic</h3>
	<p> A triadic color scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.
The colors on the color wheel create a triangular shape. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite
vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues. To use a triadic harmony
successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two
others for accent.</p>
	<h3 style="color:white">Complementary</h3>
	<p>Complementary Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel (example: red and green)</p>
