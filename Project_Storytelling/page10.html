<p id="px">I realized that I was qualified to go to college. I could reach the goal which I never imagined I could accomplish. I thought about what college I would have to go. I check CUNY and SUNY college lists. I decided to choose a CUNY college to continue my student life, because my family would not have that much money to pay the tuition and other fees. I had decided that I may major in education because I desired to become a teacher when I was in the primary school. Therefore, I choose Queens colleges on the top of the college list on my CUNY application, because it was Queens college had very good education major and provide the SEEK program which was the most suitable program for me to attend. </p>
