<p id="px">The addiction to the "Age of Empires" caused my grades to descend like the water flowing down from the mountain stream. I failed exams without any shame. When I realized the fact that the addition to the video games was the cliff I faced and the senior high school entrance examination was a tiger was run after me, but it was too late to build a bridge across the cliff to survive, because I was a ninth grade student who must take senior entrance examination next month. This examination was the future of my life as a school student. I must get average grades on nine subjects' exam on the senior high school entrance examination to get admitted to a high school. It was so challenging to that I must learn all the knowledge I had missed in the past two years. It was mission impossible. I gave up easily and continue to play "Age of Empires".</p>
