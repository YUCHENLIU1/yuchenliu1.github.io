<p id="px">At eleven years old, I registered into the worst middle school in my home town, named Tangtou junior high school. The reputation of the middle school I attended was awful. The enrollment rate was extremely low. Good students were rare animal in this middle school. Some students said this middle school was the tomb for worthy students, the paradise for bad students. Whereas, I just regard it as a cold jest. I was studying hard in the class and proud of the superior grade I got. And yet, the challenge began, I started to playing "Age of Empires" at age twelve. I was cutting class constantly, because I wanted to play "Age of Empires" with friends in the internet bar. I was proud of my rank on the games, and I was excited to guide friends on how to become a skillful player. Play the "Age of Empires" was just like to eat lunch everyday when I feel hungry. I was enjoyed to play video games and living in the virtual world. </p>
