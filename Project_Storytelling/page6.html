<p id="px">In February 2010, I finally arrived in America. I attended John Bowne High School. I felt uncomfortable in the classroom, and in the crowded hallway. When I saw my ESL teacher, an old woman, wore very formal clothes. She spoke in English which made me feel I was stupid because I did understand anything she said. I did not know how to ask her what she was talking about in class. It made me become a really self-abased person. I went home and played games every day and this condition never changed. I did know how to overcome the addiction to video games. My history teacher named Mrs. Liew advised me to find a tutor, because I had talked to her that I had a big problem to study English, but I did not mention anything about the time I had spent on playing the video games when she wanted me translate a paragraph in class. When the freshmen years ended, the summer vacation in America began. Mrs. Liew advised me to go to summer school to study English. Nevertheless, I was lazy and only play video games for my entire summer vacation. </p>
