<p id="px">Unlike America, China only had a nine-year compulsory education system which means if I could not get the passing grades, then I could not attend any high school in China. Therefore, the only choice for me was to find a low paying job. My future would be rough, hopeless and poor. I could not get what I want. I could not live in my own house and drive my own car. Nevertheless, these were the fact. I felt hopeless and no desire to be a school student anymore. Then, a miracle occurred. My family was informed by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services that my father completed the complex applications for Petition for Alien Relative after he came to America ten years ago. When we received this notice, it was the second chance.</p>
