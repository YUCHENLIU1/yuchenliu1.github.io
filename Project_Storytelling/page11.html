<p id="px">Now, I am a student at Queens College. It was the most significant accomplishment in my life. This was the outcomes I wanted and the goal I desired. The challenge I had finally overcome the video games addiction. Although, when I was extremely loath to delete all the games on my computer, but the outcome made me felt that I was a real person living in a real world not the person who living in the virtual world. I found what I really want to do and what I can do to get a better future. I have opportunity to pursue my dream. It taught me that face the challenge and find people that can help you overcome the challenge because sometimes it's very hard to overcome a challenge by yourself, also, never give up. </p>
