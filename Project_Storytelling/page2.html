<p id="px">I had desired to be a student anymore because I would fail the senior high school entrance examination, because I could not overcome the addiction to the game and I gave up. However, before the exam, a notice from America changed my life. It was an opportunity for me to go to America and start a totally different life. It was a miracle at the right time of my life. I had better to made a choice between playing games and continue to be a student. I made this choice because of the teacher Mrs. Liew I met her at John Bowne High School in America. She encouraged me to study hard and get a higher education. I stop playing games and start to study hard and got better grades than I was in China. This was where I got hope from. After a period of struggle, I finally went to Queens College to continue my student life. I felt that I was overcome the addiction to the video games and accomplished the goal to get a higher education. It taught me to face the challenge and never give up.</p>
