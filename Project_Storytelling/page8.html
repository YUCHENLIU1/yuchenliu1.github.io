<p id="px">After this conversation, She constantly made me stay in front of the class and speak louder about what I wrote for my homework. She had talked to my other teachers about me. Therefore, she assigned extra homework for me, like finding definitions for the words in the handout she gave to me. More importantly, Mrs Liew was Chinese Club adviser. She told me to join the club. So, I attended various activities the club provides for their members after school, so I made many friends. My English got better than before. I felt cheerful to spend more time to go out with these friends. Also, Mrs. Liew reminded me that I must study hard and get good grades to go to college. She said, "I hope you can go to college and get a higher education because you can do it. " Learning English helped me to overcome the video game addiction and be a student instead of a gamer. As a result, I deleted all the games on my computer. Even though, I felt like I got divorce and my family were broken, but I believe what Mrs. Liew had said to me. My exam grades ascended like the mountaineer climbing the mountain peak. </p>
