<p id="px">When junior year began, Mrs. Liew talked me to come to her classroom after school. She asked me "What do you want to do when you graduate from high school? " I answered "I don't know. " And then she asked "Why ?" "The only thing I do well is to playing video games." I said. She asked me to explain and I told her about my past, about the horrible grades I had in China and the challenge to overcome the video games addiction. She was the first person that knew my weakness and challenge. Therefore, she tried to encourage me and told me about many students who had the same experience like me. She explained to me how important it was to control myself, but it was not helpful. </p>
