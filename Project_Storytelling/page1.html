<p id="px">One of the most important things in my life is to overcome the video games addiction. At thirteen years old, I had video games addiction in too deep. At that time, I was a ninth grade in Tangtou junior high school who had to take the senior high school entrance examination next month. The addiction to the game called "Age of Empires" became a huge challenge for me to overcome, because I was not able to concentrate my attention to review the exam. My mind was occupied by the characters and scenario on age of empires. I feel it was a biggest challenge in my life, because I could live without the video games. It was so challenging for me to stop playing games and to employ myself in study.</p>
