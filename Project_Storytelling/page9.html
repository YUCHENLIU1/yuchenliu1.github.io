<h1 style="color:white"><center>Paragraph Eight</center></h1>
<p id="px">When the succeeding season had come, my counselor told me to attend a college fair because I was a senior. When the school day ended, I went to this college fair with my friends. This was the first time I understood what college really is. My friends were talking about which college they wished to go and what major they wished to study, whereas, my mind was empty and confused. So, I asked them to explain colleges and majors. That night, I remembered Mrs. Liew had said to me she wanted me to go to college and get a higher education. I checked my grade-point average online on the school's website. It was unbelievable. My grade-point average went up from 68 to 83.  </p>
